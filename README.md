# About me
Hi my name is Timm.

I am 32 years old and live with my wife and daughter in Berlin.

## Programming Experience
I already have some prior programming experience.
* In school we had some projects with Power Pascal and with Delphi, but I can't code with these languages anymore.

* In the Covid years I did a Webdeveloper Course. So I'm able to code with Javascript and can use the Framework Angular.


* I also know some fundamentals of Java and Python at the moment.

You can look up my [Website](www.Timm-Eichholz.de) and find some projects I did in the prior course.
